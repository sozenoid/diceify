# diceify
making images with dices.

This is tool to preview images made out of dices (1,2,3,4,5,6). Black dices with white dots and white dices with black dots are obviously very similar (just remove the 225- when saving the image at the last line to invert the image)

Update the number of dices as n_dices to increase the resolution of the "diced" image.
